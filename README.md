Author: Yining Shan, Yun Gao, Yue Liu, Xia Zhao  
 
## Description
The purpose of our project is to help people understand the activity of email thread in a easier way because most of the unprofessional people are not very familiar with this concept. We want to extract some hidden email thread information in our given raw dataset through our visualization project. Then, people can easily figure out the information about email thread, like the number of threads with 2 people involved. The result of our project can also represent some interesting point about peopleâ€™s habit using email.
