Our project aims to help investigators to know the habit of the user by exploring one of the
user e-mail dataset through information virtualization tool. In this way, the investigators can
understand the factors about when they send advertisements.
We need to analyze different factors that influences response time. The key content is to find
the email habit of the specific user.
DataThe purpose of this project is to help merchant investigate userâ€™s habit on sending and
responding emails. In real life, commercial advertiser needs to know what is the best
moment for them to send the advertisement to their subscribers. They want to send their
e-mails when people are more likely to read and response.
