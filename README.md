# Email thread visualization


Hello there! 
This a project about
information visualization of the E-mail thread.

Author: Yining Shan, Yun Gao, Yue Liu, Xia Zhao  
 
## Description
The purpose of our project is to help people understand the activity of email thread in a easier way because most of the unprofessional people are not very familiar with this concept. We want to extract some hidden email thread information in our given raw dataset through our visualization project. Then, people can easily figure out the information about email thread, like the number of threads with 2 people involved. The result of our project can also represent some interesting point about peopleâ€™s habit using email.

### Links and Email
#### Inline
Just put angle brackets around an email and it becomes clickable: <uranusjr@gmail.com>  
`<uranusjr@gmail.com>`  

Same thing with urls: <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>  
` <http://macdown.uranusjr.com>`  

Perhaps you want to some link text like this: [Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")  
`[Macdown Website](http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title")` (The title is optional)  


#### Reference style
Sometimes it looks too messy to include big long urls inline, or you want to keep all your urls together.  

Make [a link][arbitrary_id] `[a link][arbitrary_id]` then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"`
  
If the link text itself would make a good id, you can link [like this][] `[like this][]`, then on it's own line anywhere else in the file:  
`[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com`  

[arbitrary_id]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com "Title"
[like this]: http://macdown.uranusjr.com  


### Images
#### Inline
`![Alt Image Text](path/or/url/to.jpg "Optional Title")`
